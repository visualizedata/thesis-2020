TIMELINE TEXTS

STEP 1

This is a timeline of all of the publicly reported academic sexual misconduct cases in the US. There is a total of 1030 reported cases from 1979 to 2020, as of April 1, 2020. Only cases with known outcomes are shown here (all cases in 2020, and a portion of cases in 2019 are still unresolved). Note that cases of sexual misconduct are likely much higher than what is officially reported to the institutions of origin. Reports of sexual harassment have steadily increased throughout the decades, with initial cases in the late 1970s. This is perhaps largely due to the passage of laws and public of court cases that set the stage for sexual harassment cases to come. 

STEP 2

Under the Educational Amendments of 1972, the federal civil rights law Title IX was passed, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions receiving federal aid. In a landmark case in 1980 between Yale University and five of its students (Ronnie Alexander, Margery Reifler, Pamela Price, Lisa E Stone and Ann Olivarius) in 1980 (Alexander v Yale), Title IX was used for the first time in charges of sexual harassment against an educational institution. While the plaintiffs did not win the case, they succeeded in having Yale set in place a grievance procedure for students in the event that they experienced sexual harassment. It also established that sexual harassment could be considered sex discrimination under Title IX and was illegal.

In 1991, Anita Hill testified against then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings, accusing him of sexual harassment while he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In that year alone, the number of sexual harassment cases reported to the EEOC increased by 58%, and has steadily increased since.

In 2017, actress Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo, originally coined by civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006, on Twitter to highlight sexual abuse by Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein. With this, she called out for fellow survivors of sexual misconduct to step forward and join in on highlighting similar experiences. #MeToo subsequently went viral, as thousands of women publicly detailed their accounts. This triggered a massive increase in the number of reported sexual misconduct cases in the academic world as well.

STEP 3

Out of all cases, 332 of them originate from STEM fields. This is around a third of total cases. Following overall trends, reports of sexual misconduct cases have skyrocketed since 2017, when the #MeToo movement made waves throughout all of society. Many prominent scientists were exposed between 2017 and 2019 in highly publicized investigative news reports that reached beyond the immediate scientific community.

OUTCOME TEXTS

STEP 1

What happens to perpetrators of sexual misconduct once complaints are raised? Let's take a look:

STEP 2

Only an estimated 20% of the cases result in the perpetrators losing employment to the institutions, whether they get fired or their contracts get terminated. Another 20% of the perpetrators are given the opportunity to resign. The rest of the cases have resulted in a plethora of consequences, varying in degree of severity.

STEP 3

However, if you look closer at outcomes, many of them are not severe at all. The majority of them, in fact. A quarter of perpetrators resign, many in circumstances where institutions allow them to resign before an investigation is officially complete. Some conclude their academic careers by resigning. Others are suspended from teaching classes, only to resume after a few years and a few sexual harassment training courses. Institutions settle cases in court on behalf of the perpetrators; investigations are concluded with an "official warning" to the perpetrators. Particularly when the perpetrators in question are highly influential, academically accomplished, and well known, investigative action takes longer.

STEP 4

The most common STEM disciplines in which sexual misconduct cases have been reported are bioscience, psychology, and mathematics, with bioscience and psychology making up roughly 10% of STEM cases, and mathematics making up around 7% of STEM cases.

STEP 5

You can explore the cases in different outcomes by hovering over them. They are first and foremost grouped by outcomes, then disciplines, then institutions.

CASE STUDY TEXTS

STEP 1

Here we have case studies of fifteen perpetrators of misconduct whose cases resulted in initial outcomes in 2018. Each bar represents a broad timeline of events of a single perpetrator. The midpoint, or zero-point, signifies the year at which the first sexual harassment complaint was filed. The extent each bar goes to the left signifies how many years prior to the complaint the first known incident occurred. The extent each bar goes to the right signifies how many years it took for investigations to initiate and conclude after the first complaint.

STEP 2

The US Department of Education OFfice for Civil Rights (OCR) previously indicated that a typical investigation should take 60-90 calendar days following receipt of the complaint. However, in 2017, it issued a guidance saying there is no fixed time frame under which a school must complete a Title IX investigation, only indicating that it will "evaluate a school's good faith effort to conduct a fair, impartial investigation in a timely manner". Some of these cases have spanned decades, with no action on part of the institutions upon first complaint. For each of these cases, there is more than one woman who has had to come forward in order for their voices to be heard (spanning several women to 300 women).
