Another 20% of the perpetrators are given the opportunity to resign. The rest of the cases have resulted in a plethora of consequences, varying in degree of severity."

    , "description": "However, if you look closer at outcomes, many of them are not severe at all. The majority of them, in fact. A quarter of perpetrators resign, many in circumstances where institutions allow them to resign before an investigation is officially complete. Some conclude their academic careers by resigning. Others are suspended from teaching classes, only to resume after a few years and a few sexual harassment training courses. Institutions settle cases in court on behalf of the perpetrators; investigations are concluded with an 'official warning' to the perpetrators. Particularly when the perpetrators in question are highly influential, academically accomplished, and well known, investigative action takes longer."
