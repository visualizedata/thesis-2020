    , "description": "The US Department of Education OFfice for Civil Rights (OCR) previously indicated that a typical investigation should take 60-90 calendar days following receipt of the complaint.

Some of these cases have spanned decades, with no action on part of the institutions upon first complaint. For each of these cases, there is more than one woman who has had to come forward in order for their voices to be heard (spanning several women to 300 women)."
