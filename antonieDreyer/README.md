### Abstract

This thesis visualizes complex research knowledge in the field of 
Aerospace engineering for more efficient knowledge exploration, research
and learning.
Metadata from the National Commission on Aeronautics is presented
to contextualize topics that are foundational in the field of Aerospace Engineering. 
The tool aims to aid aerospace enthusiasts, technical historians and Aerospace Engineers
to navigate and explore the rich data set of archival papers.
The project simplifies archival nagivation by combining top-down "front-of-the book"
Table of Contents navigation and bottom-up "back-of-the book" index based navigation
over time.
