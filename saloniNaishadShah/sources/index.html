                The choice of a forest definition can have a large impact on estimates of deforestation and forest
                degradation areas, on the assessment of drivers of deforestation and on the development of a
                Reference Emissions Level.
                <br />
                <br />The definitions of the forest do not differentiate between natural forests and forest
                plantations. The ambiguity is these definitions are one the main concerns as the loggers might keep
                exploiting until they hit the national threshold leading to huge deforestation, forest degradation,
                biodiversity loss and loss of carbon stocks leading to increased emissions.

                Programs such as REDD+ cannot be perceived as a permanent solution for emission reductions to
                mitigate climate change as, by definition, the offset project does not reduce overall emissions. In
                most cases, the emissions reductions at one location are claimed as a justification for excess
                emission at another location.
                <br />
                <br />Indigenous forest dwellers or peasants are often criminialized and dispalced for forest
                degradation, while the corporations with industrials farms are incentivized for reducing emissions.

                After all, without evidence of the threat of deforestation, there are no emissions from
                deforestation that could be avoided – and there can be no REDD+ payment without proof that REDD+

                They have initiated a new phase of ‘green grabbing’ where land and resource grabs are done with a

                <br />
                <br />Programs such as REDD+ attempts to save the emissions from deforestation and forest
                degradation to sell the saved emissions to corporations so they can continue polluting.It’s a luring
                opportunity for a corporation to invest in forest conservation projects to offset their emissions.
                <br />
                <br />The program has become a huge economic opportunity as the REDD+ permits are sold in voluntary
                Carbon Markets. According to a report by Ecosystem Marketplace, Forestry and Land Use activities
                were used to offset 50.7 MtCO²e in 2018, creating a financial market of approximately 171.9 million
                USD in the voluntary carbon market.
