## Swamp Mindmap Outline

**THE GREAT SWAMP** 
Visualizing “An ASPECT (tbd)” of the Great Swamp as a metaphor for examining climate change and the health of our environment. Is this a question that can be answered?  Will this be of interest to biologists, conservationists, or just people who are culturally curious?

## Form - 1st 'Swamp' Prototype

![](images/Sketch1.jpg)
**Process/Thinking**

A timeline format would scroll right... various forms of data... 2-3 graphs, animation, links to film clips and 'swamp' music, storytelling visual about the fight vs. the jetport.  Another iteration is needed once I have more concrete datasets. 

**Possible Audiences** 
- Fish & Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, Ecologists, Environmentalists, Biologists, Neighboring NJ Communities

**Possible Takeaway** 
- How Nature and Popular Culture intersect? Make learning fun and entertaining?


## Swamp Prototypes

**Context**

In 1959 with the introduction of the first generation of commercial Jet airliners, the New York Port Authority announced plans to construct a giant 10,000 acre ‘Jetport’ 26 miles west of New York city in a semi-rural area known as the Great Swamp.

In the name of progress, entire small towns would be demolished, and the ecosystem and wildlife would be destroyed.  It seems that swamps are continually viewed as wasteland, and valuable real estate to pave over in the name of commerce and progress.


## The Big Idea

Show that swamps are a magical place, however are misunderstood and misused.  Can I influence the misperception of swamps and wetlands that exist all around us in the tri-state area? My goal is to show how, through the story of the Great Swamp, the dynamic struggle  to save some of our most misunderstood but valuable of ecosystems.

## Now Simplified! Big Idea

I created a 'Hero page' that would be the main visualization for this Thesis project.  I scrapped the 'scrollytelling' concept and simplified the graphics to a designed and interactive barchart that would be a repository for the data as well as the stories.  Created a Psuedo code (which is still in progress)

## Iterations, iterations. Back to square one.

![](images/sketch3.png)

I went back to the original storyboard.  As COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the swamp became a metaphor as the unseen menace that lies just under the surface.  I decided that it was important to tell the story of the 'demonization' of the swamp - back to the extended timeline series, and a story. I'm going to play with the Illustrator vector files as animated keyframes.

# Final Thesis Project

## SWAMP WALK: Stepping into the Great Swamp
Swamps have always been a source of terror and fascination but are actually valuable ecosystems. Swamp Walk uses a storytelling time series to weave together the historical and cultural prejudices and the ecological value of a swamp, along with archival graphics from the jetport battle that took place in The Great Swamp in New Jersey between 1959 to 1970.

## Future Iterations

**Add more Data** 
- Particularly about the endangered wildlife in The Great Swamp, and the continuing decrease of swamp ecosystems around the world -- this was found to be almost impossible -- confidential because of the sensitivity of people still trying to hunt/sell endangered species on the black market.  This could be its own data viz project.

**More nuance to the Water Data** 
- Chemicals, suburban runoff, impervious surfaces.

## Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to the inspiring and talented professors at Parsons: Aaron Hill, Daniel Sauter, Christian Swinehart, Richard The and Alec Barrett for sharing their immense knowledge and time; and to both of the MS graduate classes of 2019/20 for their endless encouragement, and inspiration that comes from seeing their incredibly amazing work!

And a special thanks to my children, Kian, Cole and Galen for keeping it real giving me critical and constructive evaluations of my work and most of all always being there -- I dedicate this to them.
