        {"paragraph": "Cheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy infrastructure company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana, one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world, through our ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Partners, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we created in 2007. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 100% of the general partner interest and 48.6% of the limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners. We also own and operate the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas, which is wholly owned by us."},
        {"paragraph": "The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. Cheniere Partners, through its subsidiary SPL, is currently operating five natural gas liquefaction Trains and is constructing one additional Train for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the “SPL Project”) at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification facilities owned by Cheniere Partners’ subsidiary, SPLNG, that include pre-existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe, two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline through its subsidiary, CTPL, that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines."},
        {"paragraph": "We also own the Corpus Christi LNG terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas, and are currently operating two Trains and are constructing one additional Train for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG. Additionally, we are operating a 23-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the “Corpus Christi Pipeline” and together with the Trains, the “CCL Project”) through our subsidiaries CCL and CCP, respectively. The CCL Project, once fully constructed, will contain three LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 10 Bcfe and two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters."},
        {"paragraph": "We have contracted approximately 85% of the total production capacity from the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the “Liquefaction Projects”) on a term basis. This includes volumes contracted under SPAs in which the customers are required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, as well as volumes contracted under integrated production marketing (“IPM”) gas supply agreements."},
        {"paragraph": "Additionally, separate from the CCH Group, we are developing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the CCL Project (“Corpus Christi Stage 3”) through our subsidiary CCL Stage III for up to seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 10 mtpa of LNG. We received approval from FERC in November 2019 to site, construct and operate the expansion project."},
        {"paragraph": "We remain focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand of LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We hold significant land positions at both the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal which provide opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. The development of these sites or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we can make a final investment decision (“FID”)."}
