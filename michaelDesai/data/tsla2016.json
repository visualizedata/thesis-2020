We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, Internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates.  Starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, we introduced second generation of autopilot  which has improved hardware and enhanced functionalities including better safety and performance. In 2016, our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies.  During 2016, our production volume increased by 64% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began delivering Model X sport utility vehicle.  In 2016, we greatly ramped the production and deliveries of Model X.  Also, in the first quarter of 2016, we unveiled Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, which received significant interest.  To date, we have substantially completed the design and prototypes of Model 3 and are projecting to start production and deliveries in the second half of 2017."},
