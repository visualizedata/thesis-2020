## Prototypes
For the prototypes I have used Adobe XD to create two unique designs to approach my microsite and data visualization. Below there are links to a live demo and images of the designs. Compared to my storyboard, my focus has shifted which impacted the design of the wireframes as well as the content in which I would like to depict.
