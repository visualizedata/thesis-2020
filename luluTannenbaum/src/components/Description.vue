    How does the advertising & media influence voters? In order to address this issue, this study and data visualization examines second-by-second brain data corresponding to political advertisements, news-clips, and corporate advertisements with socio-political messages. Socio-political issues and tone of voice were analyzed to understand what engages voters unconsciously.

    The project has been created in partnership with Brainsights, a neuromarketing consultancy based in Toronto, Canada. Brainsights collected both qualitative survey data and quantitative brain data using electroencephalography (EEG) during research studies in Manhattan, New York and Chattanooga, Tennessee between February 3–6, 2020. There was a total of 166 participants across the two markets.
