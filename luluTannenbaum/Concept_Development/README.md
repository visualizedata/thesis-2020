## The Research Question
For my thesis, I’m visualizing brain data because I want to show how decision making is made at the unconscious level in order to illuminate biases leading into the 2020 Presidential Election. The first image is a mind map of my concept, data, and external sources. This is followed by a re-ordered outline in both a visual and textual representation.
