      As the climate continues to warm, and extreme weather events are more
      frequent and stronger, New York City must adapt to these changes to
      maintain the health and well-being of its population. Green roofs are a
      way to do so; they provide environmental benefits such as surface
      temperature mitigation, stormwater management, and biodiversity
      conservation that improve the resiliency and adaptive capacity of the
      city. However, even though the benefits of green roofs have been greatly
      studied, and a need to implement them on a widescale in cities is
      inarguable, only 0.1% of NYCâ€™s 1 million rooftops have green roofs.
      Greening From the Rooftops was developed to transform the scientific
      literature on green roofs into a tool that the average person and decision
      maker can use. It visualizes and maps potential rooftops for implementing
      green roofs, and calculates the environmental benefits the potential green
      roof would bring if installed.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Extensive rooftops of sedum 3-5 inches were only considered for the
          benefits calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Surface temperature reduction benefits are only felt on the green roof
          and the immediate area around it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mixed property ownership and tax-exempt property ownership were
          grouped with public ownership for practical reasons.
