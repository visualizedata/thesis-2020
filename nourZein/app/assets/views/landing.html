            "Nature plays a crucial role in the life of New York City. Green
            roofs atop the cityâ€™s buildings offer environmental, economic, and
            public health benefits to our communities. Yet, less than 0.1% of
            the city's 1 million buildings have green roofs."

            Rooftops are an untapped resource. This project visualizes and maps
            potential rooftops for implementing green roofs, and calculates the
            environmental benefits they would bring if installed.
